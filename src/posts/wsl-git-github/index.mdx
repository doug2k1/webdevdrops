Following up on our [WSL setup guide](/wsl-get-started-linux-on-windows), let's dive into configuring **Git** and **GitHub** on your fresh **WSL** installation. I'll walk you through the process with some practical tips I've learned along the way.

## Why Configure Git on WSL?

If you're using WSL for development, setting up Git directly in your Linux environment makes sense. It keeps your development workflow consistent and lets you use Linux-specific tools seamlessly with Git.

## Let's Get Started! ðŸš€

Note: all commands below should be run in your Linux terminal in WSL.

### Step 1: Install Git on WSL

First, let's make sure Git is installed and up-to-date:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
git --version
```

### Step 2: Configure Your Identity

Git needs to know who you are for commit attribution. Let's set that up:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

Pro tip: Use the same email associated with your GitHub account!

### Step 3: Set Up GitHub Authentication with SSH ðŸ”‘

1. Generate an SSH key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"
```

2. Start the SSH agent:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

3. Copy your public key:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

4. Add the key to GitHub:
   - Go to GitHub â†’ Settings â†’ SSH and GPG keys ([https://github.com/settings/keys](https://github.com/settings/keys))
   - Click "New SSH key"
   - Paste your public key and give it a memorable title

5. Test your connection:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

You should see a success message like "Hi username! You've successfully authenticated..."

### Step 4: Create Your First Repository

Let's test our setup:

```bash
# Create and enter a new directory
mkdir my-test-repo
cd my-test-repo

# Initialize git
git init

# Create a test file
echo "# My Test Repo" > README.md

# Stage and commit
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### Step 5: Connect to GitHub

Now, let's push your repository to GitHub:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Connect your local repo:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/my-test-repo.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

You should see your README file on GitHub at  
https://github.com/username/my-test-repo

## Wrapping Up

You're now ready to use Git and GitHub professionally in your WSL environment!
