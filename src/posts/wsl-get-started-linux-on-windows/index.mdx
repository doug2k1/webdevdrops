Hey there! üëã

Today, I'm going to walk you through setting up **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** - a game-changer for developers who want the best of both worlds. WSL is an incredibly powerful tool that brings the **Linux** command line to your **Windows** machine, without the hassle of dual-booting or virtual machines

## Prerequisites

Before we dive in, make sure you have:

- Windows 10 version 2004 or higher (Build 19041+) or Windows 11
- Administrator access to your machine

## Let's Get Started! üöÄ

### Step 1: Install the Terminal app

First things first - let's install a decent terminal app.

[**Terminal**](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n0dx20hk701) is a free app from Microsoft. It's a modern replacement for the classic Command Prompt, and it's perfect for working with WSL.

### Step 2: Enable WSL

Using your new Terminal app, open **PowerShell** as Administrator and run this command:

```powershell
wsl --install
```

This command does several things:

- Enables the WSL and Virtual Machine Platform features
- Downloads and installs the latest Linux kernel
- Sets WSL 2 as the default version
- Installs Ubuntu (the default Linux distribution)

Once the installation is complete, you'll be prompted to restart your machine.

### Step 3: Set Up Your Linux User Account

After restarting, launch the Linux terminal. You can do this by searching for "Ubuntu" in the Start menu, or through the dropdown menu in the Terminal app.

When Ubuntu first launches, you'll need to:

1. Enter a username (doesn't have to match your Windows username)
2. Create and confirm a password

Don't panic if you don't see the password as you type - that's normal in Linux!

This account will be the Linux administrator (root) account. **Make sure to remember the password**, as you'll need it for commands that require elevated permissions (`sudo`).

## Troubleshooting üîß

Running into issues? Here are some common fixes (run the commands below in PowerShell):

**WSL Not Installing?**

```powershell
wsl --update
```

**Need to Switch WSL Versions?**

```powershell
wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2
```

**Want to See What's Running?**

```powershell
wsl --list -v
```

## Common Questions ü§î

**Where are my Linux files stored?**

WSL stores your Linux files in a hidden folder within your Windows user profile. You can access them in the Windows File Explorer by entering the path:

```
\\wsl$\Ubuntu
```

For instance, your Linux home folder, where you will work most of the time, is located at:

```
\\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\YourUsername
```

‚ö†Ô∏è It's advised to use the Linux terminal to navigate and work with your files, as the Windows File Explorer might not handle Linux file permissions correctly.

**How to access my Windows files from Linux?**

Your Windows drives are mounted under `/mnt/`. For example:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/YourUsername/Documents
```

## Wrapping Up

WSL is an incredibly powerful tool that brings the Linux command line to your Windows machine. Whether you're a web developer, system administrator, or just curious about Linux, WSL provides a fantastic way to explore and work with Linux tools while keeping your Windows workflow intact.

Remember, the best way to learn is by doing. Don't be afraid to experiment and try new things in your WSL environment!
